## centering a div

Someone on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8347427/180275) had this idea:
[centering_div_01.html](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/web/css/centering_div_01.html).


## Links

See also [inline and external javascript definitions](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/tree/master/web/js#readme)

## TODO

Of course, all of this should go to the [About CSS](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-css) repository.
