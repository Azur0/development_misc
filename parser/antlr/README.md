# ANTLR

## simpleExample

A simple but helpful example found on stack overflow, [See here](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/tree/master/parser/antlr/simpleExample#readme).

## grepWords

A [grammar](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/parser/antlr/grepWords/grepWords.g) to extract words from a string. Note the
`skip()` directive in the `WS` rule that automagically(?) skips over whitepsaces although the `WS` is not references anywhere in the grammar.
